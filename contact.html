I know that this website sucks. I never said that I could do anything of note in the front-end. Have a bnuuy instead

The best way to avoid being hacked is to not have anything of note on your web server. To that end, I'm using Github's web server :)

          <br />
          <h4>Can I send you my game ideas?</h4>
          <p>As much as we'd love to listen to your elevator pitch, we can't accept your game ideas or even look at them for legal reasons. If you send them to us, into the trash they go.</p>
          <br />
          <h4>Can we hire you to do _____?</h4>
          <p>As a company, we're only making our own software at the moment. That doesn't mean, however, that in the future, we won't be available to do artwork or sound for your game.</p>
          <br />
          <h4>"My name is leslie from Credit Solutions"</h4>
          <p>Hi leslie, unfortunately, the studio doesn't have any debt because we also don't have any money to get into debt with. Womp womp. We wish you the best of luck with your 419 scam.</p>
