I know that this website sucks. I never said that I could do anything of note in the front-end. Have a bnuuy instead

The best way to avoid being hacked is to not have anything of note on your web server. To that end, I'm using Github's web server :)

          <p>Three Wizards is a fiercly independent little game studio from the United Kingdom (The little archipelago in the Atlantic)</p>
          <p>We make games that we ourselves would like to play in the hopes that others might like them too.</p>
          <p>Check out the team below:</p>

          <br />
          <h4>Creative Director, lead programmer, sound designer, artist?, producer, game design, lover, philanthropist.</h4>
          <p>Chloe has been in the games industry off and on again for over 10 years in roles such as QA, game art, programming, production, and studio leadership.</p>
          <p>Besides being the boss here, she founded Three Wizards and does all the stuff listed above.</p>
          <p>She also made this trash website in a rush and runs our tiny company from a narrowboat on the canals of England and Wales.</p>

         <br />
         <h4>Lead artist, game design, QA, expert, prodigy, pixel pusher, grid based wizard</h4>
         <p>Allister (Real name unknown, motives unknown) is our resident artist extraordinaire. His work has always been impressive no matter what angle you look at it, even upside down.</p>
         <p>He might not understand technical programmer babble, but if you can break it down into layman's terms then we're all on the same page.</p>
         <p>Occassionaly, Allister is a freeloader on Chloe's boat.</p>
