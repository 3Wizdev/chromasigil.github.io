          <p>Chloe has been in the games industry off and on again for over 10 years in roles such as QA, game art, programming, production, and studio leadership.</p>
          <p>Besides being the boss here, she founded Chroma Sigil and does all the stuff listed above.</p>

         <p>Allister is our resident artist extraordinaire. His work has always been impressive no matter what angle you look at it, even upside down.</p>
         <p>He might not understand much of what Chloe says when she's on one, but he's learning fast.</p>
         <p>Occassionaly, Allister can be found consuming tapioca boba at an alarming rate.</p>
