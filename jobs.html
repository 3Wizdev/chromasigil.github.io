The best way to avoid being hacked is to not have anything of note on your web server. To that end, I'm using Github's web server :)

          <p>Damn, that kind of sucks. We were hoping that you might one day come join us here at Three Wizards And Associates. Not like, physically, or anything. We work remote.</p>
          <p>Keep checking back from time to time or follow us on social media to be kept up to date on when we're hiring and send us your links when we do. Who knows what could happen? Your résumé and portfolio might blow us away in such a way that can't even be quantified or calculated by modern methods. You might have something there that makes us do that thing that cartoons do when their eyes end up on the outside of their bodies. Is that healthy for them? I don't really know.</p>
          <p>Anyways, we'll keep you posted.</p>
